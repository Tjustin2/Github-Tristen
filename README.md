Week 4:
Applying the logistic regression. Better understanding of the confusion matrix method.
Week 5:
Learning Poisson Regression and Gamma Regression.
Week 6:
Using random forest and decision tree on a data set. Decision Trees are easier to interpret. However, the slightest change to them would cause a drastic change. Random forest is random sampling and give high prediction power.
